86G 90N_2 90N_3

91bg Fe too wide 86G 03gs (08Q?)

give up the bad fitting spectra? do!
new data recording file

confine model: the latest one

early Co prominent: 86G 02bo

set up tools: statistic correlation 730 745; histgram ..... done

divide <300 and closet to 250; >300 and closet to 350
change order of SNe Ia

part-time:
	Function of BBB 1,2
	Formation of BBB 3
	Method of BBB 4-14

	BBB:
		function: 
			protect brain from toxins and pathogens; matintains homeostasis and proper function of CNS
		formation: 
			CNs ECs:
				function: 
					express specialzied tight junctions -> small molecules
					lack fenestrae and exhibit a low rate of transcytosis -> large molecules
					express transporters -> essential nutrients
	Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway:
		function:
			key regulator of BBB development and maintenance.
		component:
			multiprotein receptor complexes:
				Frizzled4, LRP6...:
					position: 
						brain ECs
					ligands:
						Wnt7a,7b and Norrin
					function:
						receptor activation -> TCF and LEF1 transcription factors:
							function:
								control expression of a BBB-specific gene expression repertoire(???)
							method:
								inducing tight junction, solute transporter and efflux transporter expression, and by repressing expression of the permeability protein PLVAP that forms the diaphragm in EC fenestrae, caveolae and transcytotic vesicles
	Unc5B:
		background:
			among the four vertebrate Unc5 family members, only Unc5B is expressed in ECs in mice and humans.
		component:
			ECD(???):
				Netrin-1
				Robo4
				Flrt2
			ICD:
				membrane-proximal ZU5 domain
				UPA domain
				death domain
		function:
			mediated:
				ICD, mediate apoptosis in the absence of ligand
		method:
			domain -> supramodule:
				suppress Unc5B: ZU5 binds to both UPA and DD
				activate Unc5B: ligands binding to Unc5B triggers a conformational change

how to talk a good story?
what I want to clear? most -> subC but be carefule; Si velocity diversity; brighter -> subC confused; difference between 91bg and other;
what I have? ratio_phase; ratio vs. Si; ratio vs. 15;

A Great Goal--Artis:
	paper method:
		"make everything clear"
		atomic parameters
		estimator
		NLTE
		non-thermal
	code realization

20220822:
	goal:
		finish the paper in next 5 days
		day1:
			read the all paper, polish and record problems
		day2:
			contact boss and polish paper
	the first question:
		how to cope with SN 2017fgc in section 2.1?

20220823:
	paper:
		title:
			constraining? implications?
		author:
			institutions
		abstract:
			remove "improved"
			fraction expression
			add deltam vs. Ni/Fe 
		Introduction:
			email
			remove "this relation can be attributed to"
			induce Ni/Fe
		Data:
			17fgc? how to describe our project?
			in prep
		Method:
			Co III
		Result:

		Acknowledge:
			add what? Funds?

基础知识：
	基础概念
	公式定理

运用：
	基础知识+思考尝试->答案

1+(-5)=?

常用的一些思考方式：
	逆推
	凑数

所谓难->"复杂"，熟练即可->刷题，积累经验
